On a very hot summer day in the fields a thirsty crow flew everywhere in search of water
Suddenly his gaze landed on a pitcher on the ground with little water in it
 The water level was too low and the pitcher had a narrow neck because of 
 which the crow could not drink the water. Then an idea came to him
